# Lodel Data Interoperability Bundle

This bundle is developed as part of the **CRAFT-OA Project (https://www.craft-oa.eu/)** funded by the European Union (**HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01** Grant Agreement: 101094397). It aims to support interoperability and transformation workflows in scholarly publishing.

It introduces a transformation step that converts **JATS-Publishing** files into **TEI-Commons** using **M√©topes XSLT** stylesheets.
The transformation is executed prior to the import and validation process in **Lodel 2.0**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This bundle requires Lodel 2.0 (which may not yet be available)**. For more information, visit: [Lodel 2.0 Announcement](https://leo.hypotheses.org/22760) ‚ö†Ô∏è

üìΩÔ∏è **Video Demonstration**: A demonstration video of this bundle is available here: [Nakala Platform](https://api.nakala.fr/embed/10.34847/nkl.4a0ab841/340eddb033b6ab933348a3842ba5f34eb34b7930).

## Requirements

Before installing this bundle, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **PHP**: Version 8.1 or higher.
- **PHP Extensions**: ```dom```, ```mbstring```, ```xml```, ```xmlwriter```
- **Composer**: To manage dependencies.
- **Java**: OpenJDK 11 or higher, required for running XSLT transformations with Saxon.

## Installation

From the root directory of your Lodel application, declare the repository source:
```bash
$ composer config repositories.lodel/lodel-interoperability-bundle vcs git@gitlab.huma-num.fr:openedition/lodel/lodel-interoperability-bundle.git
```

Then add the dependency:
```bash
$ composer require lodel/lodel-interoperability-bundle:dev-main
```

The bundle should be automatically usable without requiring additional configuration.

## Defining transformations

### _Configuration_

Transformations must be configured in [```src/Resources/config/packages/lodel_data_interoperability.yaml```](src/Resources/config/packages/lodel_data_interoperability.yaml). Each transformation entry requires:

- A unique identifier (the key, e.g., ```jatsToTei```) used internally.
- A human-readable label (```label```) that describes the transformation.
- A list of XSLT ```files``` executed in order by Saxon. Each step processes the output of the previous one.

This structure allows chaining multiple transformation steps while keeping configuration centralized and explicit.

Example:
```bash
lodel_data_interoperability:
    (...)
    transformation:
        jatsToTei:
            label: JATS to TEI
            files:
                - jats_to_tei-1.xsl
                - jats_to_tei-2.xsl
```

This example defines a transformation named ```jatsToTei```, which converts JATS XML into TEI XML using two sequential XSLT files.

### _Stylesheets_

All XSLT files required for the transformation processes ‚Äî including both the executable stylesheets (listed in the configuration) and any supporting/imported stylesheets ‚Äî must be placed in the [```src/Resources/stylesheets/```](src/Resources/stylesheets/) directory. This ensures they are correctly located and accessible during Saxon processing.

## External resources

### _Saxon script_

The [```saxon-he-10.6.jar```](src/Resources/scripts/) file is part of the Saxon-HE product, which is distributed under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0.

## Documentation

This bundle uses Doxygen to generate code documentation.
Doxygen reads PHPDoc comments to produce browsable HTML documentation.
Ensure Doxygen is installed on your system. You can install it via:

```bash
$ apt-get install doxygen
```

Run the following command to generate the documentation:

```bash
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated HTML documentation will be available in ```docs/html/```.
Open ```index.html``` in a browser to view it.
If the code changes, rerun the above steps to update the documentation.

## Makefile Commands

This project includes a ```Makefile``` to simplify common development tasks.
Below are the available commands and their usage:

- ```make quality```: Runs PHP-CS-Fixer and PHPStan to ensure code quality and perform static analysis.  
- ```make security```: Uses Symfony's security check to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- ```make tests```: Executes all automated tests with PHPUnit to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues

1. Java Not Installed: Ensure Java is installed and accessible in your environment. Verify by running:

```bash
$ java --version
```

2. Missing PHP Extensions: Install required PHP extensions:

```bash
$ apt-get install -y php-xml php-mbstring
```
